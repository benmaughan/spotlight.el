* spotlight.el
Emacs package to search for files using Mac OS X spotlight.

* Overview
The functionality is similar to e.g. ~rgrep~ with the advantages that

 - The search is quicker as it queries the spotlight database.
 - The search can be performed dynamically, updating as the search
   string is changed
 - The list of file names can be dynamically narrowed by typing a
   filter
 - When a file is selected it is opened with a ~swiper~ search running
   with the original search query

* Functions
Provides two functions. These are:

  1) ~spotlight~, which prompts for a query string and searches the
     spotlight database with dynamic updates for each new character
     entered. You'll be given a list of files that match. Selecting a
     file will launch ~swiper~ for that file searching for the query
     string.

     Alternatively, the user can use ~M-f~ to dynamically filter the
     list of matching files to reduce the number of matches before
     selecting a file.

  2) ~spotlight-fast~ is the same as ~spotlight~ but the user is
     prompted for a query string to search the spotlight database
     without incremental updates. This can be much faster than
     ~spotlight~. The list of matching files containing the query string
     in their bodies are presented and the user can select the file or
     type a string to dynamically filter the list of files by filename.
     The selected file is then opened and a ~swiper~ search using the
     original query is launched.

* Example
In the animation below, I run a spotlight search for "tomatoes".
Notice how the number of matches updates as I type or delete the last
couple of characters. I then use ~M-f~ to narrow the list of matching
files using the string "docs org$" which narrows the list to files
with "doc" in their full name, and with names ending in "org". Finally
once a select the file, ~swiper~ takes me to the matches of my
original "tomatoe" query.

* Installation
The best way to install this package is from MELPA using
~package-list-packages~.

* Customisation
Customise the variable ~spotlight-min-chars~ to set the minimum
number of characters that must be entered before the first
spotlight search is performed in ~spotlight~. Setting
~spotlight-min-chars~ to a lower number will result in more matches
and can lead to slow performance.

Customise the variable ~spotlight-base-dir~ to specify the default
base directory for the spotlight search for both ~spotlight~ and
~spotlight-live~. The spotlight database will be queried for files
below this directory. Default is user's home directory. Use '/' to
search everywhere. Alternatively, both ~spotlight~ and
~spotlight-fast~ can be called with a prefix argument, in which
case they will prompt for a base directory.

* Known issues
 - When a query with multiple words is used, OS X spotlight will
   return a list of files containing those words anywhere in the body.
   When one is selected, the ~swiper~ search will search for the query
   string but will only find matches where all of the words in the
   query are on the same line in the file.

   In this case, use e.g. ~M-DEL~ to remove words from the ~swiper~
   string until matches are found.

 - The list of spotlight matches is not updated if the next key
   results in zero matches.

* Planned improvements
 - Add customisable lists of file extensions to include or exclude
   from results.
 - Add customisable list of preferred order of file extensions used to
   sort the results.
